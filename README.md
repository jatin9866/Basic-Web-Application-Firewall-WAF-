# Basic-Web-Application-Firewall-WAF-

This Python project uses Flask, a web framework, to create a simple web server that can protect against basic web threats. It provides five security features:

IP Blocking: Blocks requests from specific IP addresses.

SQL Injection Detection: Looks for malicious SQL code in form data.

XSS Detection: Detects Cross-Site Scripting attacks in user input.

Rate Limiting: Prevents too many requests from the same IP in a short time.

Request Logging: Logs every incoming request (IP and what they accessed).
